            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>
                Founded by co-founders and Gunn High School students Alex Misra and Arda Turgut, Gunn Pickleball is dedicated to fostering a 
                positive and inclusive atmosphere within the Gunn High School community. 
                In a stressful academic environment, we believe that pickleball—a 
                lightweight, fun, and community-driven sport—provides the perfect 
                outlet for students. Our goal is to offer a space where everyone 
                can unwind, whether through rallying with friends, playing competitive 
                games, or just enjoying the game in a relaxed manner.
            </p>
            <p>
                We emphasize the importance of building connections and friendships 
                within the club, creating a supportive network for all members. 
                Above all, we prioritize having fun. Whether you're a seasoned player 
                or just looking to try something new, our club is a place to enjoy 
                the sport without pressure. We also recognize the need to balance 
                academic responsibilities with physical activity. Our club encourages 
                an active lifestyle that complements school life, helping students 
                manage stress and stay active.
            </p>

                        <p> 
                            Alex got into pickleball after the PE pickleball unit, 
                            where he experienced the mental and physical health 
                            benefits of the sport. Outside of pickleball, Alex 
                            is a black belt in karate and loves indulging in 
                            nature through hikes and his recent passion for 
                            nature photography.

                        <p>
                            Arda’s interest in pickleball sparked after noticing 
                            its vast popularity at Mitchell Park, where he quickly 
                            joined in on the fun. A music enthusiast, Arda is proficient 
                            in both piano and cello and also enjoys playing volleyball.

                            Zain first played pickleball with a few family friends and 
                            quickly developed a love for the game. Besides pickleball, 
                            Zain has a deep passion for soccer, having played it most 
                            of his life, and is a passionate Liverpool fan.

                            Richard discovered pickleball through a friend and quickly 
                            found joy in the game. He improved his skills by playing at 
                            Mitchell Park against more experienced opponents. Outside of 
                            pickleball, Richard enjoys music and volleyball and is proud 
                            of his growth in both skill and height.
